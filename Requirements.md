#µBar Requirements

Below are the requirements for the µBar system. The µBar consists of two main components: the mobile app and the µBar device itself. A central server that handles all the HTTP requests may be introduced into the system, but the decision is yet to be made. This is purely a requirements document describing the behavior of the system, the design and implementation are to exist in a separate document(s).

##System Level Requirements
  * The µBar system is desgined to give users a fun and easy way to make beverages of all kinds - automating the pouring process through the use of custom hardware (the µBar device). 
  * The µBar system is to provide an intuitive user interface, allowing user to create orders on their mobile devices (iOS & Android), via the touch screen on the µBar device, or by speaking the order to the µBar device.
  * The µBar device hardware shall be modular and easy to sanitize - especially the valves, nozzles, and tanks. 
  * The µBar device shall allow users to customize the inventory of beverages with modular tanks; also  offer the additional option of a refrigeration/cooling system for the beverage tanks.
  * The µBar device shall offer proximity sensing, greeting users when near the µBar device.
  * The µBar system shall provide users with possible beverage combinations, based on current inventory.

###Software
  * iOS & Android mobile applications
  * Linux-based OS targetted for an embedded computing system
  * Voice recognition & natural language processing
  * Proximity sensing and greeting

###Hardware
  * Staggered arrangement of nozzles (8 total)
  * Modular/Sanitizable/Coolable tanks
  * Touchscreen for user input
  * LED lighting
  * Materials
     * Metal based chassis w/plastic exterior
  * Stable tray system (holds cups of different size/weight)
