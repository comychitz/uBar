#The µBar 
The µBar is a device that automates the process of mixing and pouring beverages. It was first implemented as an unergraduate senior design project, which is what we refer to as Version 1 of the µBar. After learning what worked, what can be improved, and what was missing from the project, we have decided to give a stab at this thing again - hopefully with much more success this time. 

##Overview
A high level block diagram (to be added below) shows the µBar at the system level. There are two main components: a mobile application and the µBar device. There may be a central server introduced into the system that would host the µBar backend and user data, however, the decision has not been completed made. At this point we assume the mobile application will talk directly to the µBar device, via HTTP messages over a local WiFi network.
